# TOUni

Welcome to TOUni! 

TOUni is a web-based application that allows students to virtually tour Canadian universities and experience student life. In this way, weâ€™ll bring you TO Uni, and university TO U. Our team created this web app as part of TOHacks 2020, and we've uploaded our minimum viable product here! 

In this version, we have included functionality for saving and viewing markers using Firebase and the Google Maps Web API. To preview the web application, select "University of Waterloo" in the search bar from index.html to access the campus map with premade markers. 

We recognize there are still lots of improvements to be made and features to add, but we're excited to see where this goes!
