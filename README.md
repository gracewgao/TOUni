# TOUni

Welcome to TOUni! 

Here, youâ€™ll find our Minimum Viable Product, which includes functionality for saving and viewing markers using Firebase and the Google Maps Web API. To preview the web application, select "University of Waterloo" in the search bar from index.html to access the campus map with premade markers. 

We recognize there are still improvements to be made but we were inspired to continue editing and produce a spectacular final product! We had a lot of fun making it so thank you for this opportunity!
